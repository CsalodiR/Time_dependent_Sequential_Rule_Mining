Dear User,

We appreciate the time you've taken to study our algorithms. Before you begin, I recommend visiting the webpage of the SPMF toolbox to better understand how sequences are represented. Also it is worth to download the updated version of the toolbox.

You can access it through this link: https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/RuleGen.php

In this package, you will find four Python scripts:

Generate_Data: This script allows you to change the parameters for data synthesis and experiment with different datasets.

Training_Module: You can train your model by executing this script.

Prediction_Module: This script enables you to predict events by implementing antecedent parts.

functions: Complex subalgorithms are called from this script, enhancing your understanding of the previous files.

We hope you enjoy using the algorithm. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
